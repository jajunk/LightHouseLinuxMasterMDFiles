# How to shutdown and restart in terminal

1. To **shutdown** the system immediately:
    ```bash
    sudo shutdown -h now
    ```

2. To **restart** the system immediately:
    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

3. If you want to schedule a shutdown or restart after a specific time (e.g., 10 minutes from now), you can use:
    ```bash 
    sudo shutdown -h +10
    sudo shutdown -r +10
    ```
